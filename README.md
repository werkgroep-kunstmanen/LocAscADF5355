# LocAscADF5355
With this Arduino sketch you can set the frequency of the ADF5355.
The LCD keypad Shield is used to show the selected frequency. With the Up- and Down-key you can scroll through the preset frequencies. The Select-key will update the ADF5355.
The Left-key sets a divide by 8, so you can see the signal on a spectrum analyser.
Please make sure that you use level converters, because the ADF5355 only allows 3V3-signals.
Pin 3 and 11 are used as a power supply for the level converters.
